# Expass 2

## Technical problems

At the start I had some issues with finding out where the DB was stored locally. Luckily I got some help from the TA in the lab on wednesday.

Had some problems with getting apache derby to work a couple of times through the project. This was mostly solved by adding it to the pom.xml

When I started making my own eclipselink projects through Intellij there was some problems choosing it instead of Jakarta persistence which seems to be the most normal library to use.

## Inspection of database

I used apache derby through Intellij to inspect the DB. Once I learned how to use the tool it helped me a lot.

## Pending issues

I still need to learn a bit more about relations in eclipselink, but I think it worked out alright
